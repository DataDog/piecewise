    """ Fits a piecewise (aka "segmented") regression and creates a scatter plot
    of the data overlaid with the regression segments.

    Params:
        t (listlike of ints or floats): independent/predictor variable values
        v (listlike of ints or floats): dependent/outcome variable values
        min_stop_frac (float between 0 and 1): the fraction of total error that
            a merge must account for to be considered "too big" to keep merging;
            the default is usually adequate, but this may be increased to make
            merging more aggressive (leading to fewer segments in the result)
        model (FittedModel) a previously fit model, if available
    Returns:
        None.
